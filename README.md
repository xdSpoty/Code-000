# Code-000

Code-000 is a simple [Aniworld](https://aniworld.to/) donwlaod script written in Python. You can either download just one episode or a whole season. I recommend to use screens to download several series at the same time.

## How to use

- Clone the Repo
- install the requirments
    ```sh
    $ pip install -r src/requirements.txt
    ```
- run ```main v1.4.1.py``` or ```dwlndepisode.py```
    ```sh 
    $ python3 scripts/main\ v1.4.2.py 
    $ python3 scripts/dwlndepisode.py
    ```
- ```sh
  $ Link: # The link structure has to be like => https://aniworld.to/anime/stream/jujutsu-kaisen
  ```

- ```sh
  $ Season: # Number of the Season
  ```

- ```sh
  $ Episode: # Number of Episodes
  ```

- ```sh
  $ Language: # Select the language in which you want to download the episodes
  ```
